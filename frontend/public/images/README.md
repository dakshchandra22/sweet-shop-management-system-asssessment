# Images Directory

This directory is for storing images used in the application.

## Recommended Images

You can add the following images to enhance the UI:

1. **Logo** - `logo.png` or `logo.svg` (for navbar)
2. **Favicon** - `favicon.ico` (for browser tab)
3. **Hero Image** - `hero.jpg` (for landing page, if needed)
4. **Sweet Category Icons** - Individual icons for different sweet categories

## Image Sources

You can use free image sources like:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

## Current Implementation

Currently, the application uses emoji icons (🍬, 🍰, 🍭) for sweet categories, which work well and don't require external images. However, you can replace these with actual images if desired.
